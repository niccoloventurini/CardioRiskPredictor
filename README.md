This repository contains code of the ML Project 1  of group MIN, composed by Irene Vardabasso, Niccol√≤ Venturini Degli Esposti and Mathilde Chaffard.
To run the code it is necessary to create a folder inside the folder 'project1', the new folder has to be called 'data'. That folder needs to have these files inside: x_test.csv, x_train.csv, y_train.csv.
Moreover inside the project1 folder there is both a run.py file and a run.ipynb file, they are the same but the latest is the notebook.
